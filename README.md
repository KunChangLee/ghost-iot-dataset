# ghost-iot-dataset
Smart-home network traffic IoT dataset

**GHOST** -- Safe-Guarding Home IoT Environments with Personalised Real-time Risk Control -- is a European Union Horizon 2020 Research and Innovation funded project that aims to develop a reference architecture for securing smart-homes IoT ecosystem

 The **GHOST-IoT-data-set** is a public data-set containing IoT network traffic collected with the deployment of the GHOST's capturing module in a real life smart-home installation, with multiple network interfaces and devices. During the capturing, abnormal functioning of devices has been intentionally triggered, to construct a data-set that enables the development of mechanisms that can conduct behavioral analysis against the activity in the smart-home.

 The data-set is going to be available after the publication of the corresponding paper.
